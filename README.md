# FAMILIADA - Mini game

Familiada is very old TV-show in Poland, this game is imitating real game from
the show. It was my very first React project(branch Familiada-Old), created for
my friend's wedding as a mini game(with different set of questions). Then I
decided to make it also my first real project with Redux.
